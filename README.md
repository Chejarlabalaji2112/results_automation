# RESULTS_AUTOMATION 
-->As a mini project, I developed a program which automates the results getting process. 

-->No need to search where is your results in a pile of links  and clicking on each sem link and enter the roll number and print those results.  

-->Because , you can get results of a particular semester or all in one go with this tool.  

-->and also you can even specify how you want the results either on screen or save in current working directory. 

-->or you can even check your recent results are uploaded in your college website or not and get notified.  

--alternatively a new file is also added which is results_bot.py , use the code and get your bot fetch results for your in the format of files...
