# results_automation
As a mini project, I developed a program which automates the results getting process.
No need to search where is your results in a pile of links  and clicking on each sem link and enter the roll number and print those results.
Because , you can get results of a particular semester or all in one go with this tool.
and also you can even specify how you want the results either on screen or save in current working directory.
or you can even check your recent results are uploaded in your college website or not and get notified.
